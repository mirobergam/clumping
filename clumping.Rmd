Do students clump by gender in Gov 1006? 

Let's ignore the table with all graduate students, since this will never clump. Let's ignore the table with two graduate students. (It is always a good idea to make the initial version of a simulation as simple as possible.) There are 30 remaining students: 16 men and 14 women. Our null model is that they sit down randomly. We can ignore the last two students since they are, by assumption, sitting at the table with 2 graduate students. This leaves us with 28 students (chosen randomly from the 30 undergraduates) sitting at 7 tables of 4 students each.

Define a "clump" as a table of four, all of the same gender. (Other definitions of clumping are possible. One aspect of data science is going from a verbal description to a mathematical formulation.) In class on February 12th, there were three such tables. Is that surprising? Is it evidence of clumping? If students sat randomly, how unusual would it be to see three single-gender tables?


```{r tools}
# Before we run the simulation, we need the basic data and some simple
# functions. Removing the graduate students, there are 16 men and 14 women in
# the class. Let's use a vector to represent that information. Implicitly, the
# first four values in the vector sit at table 1, the second four sit at table 2
# and so on.

class30 <- c(rep("M", 16), rep("F", 14))

seat_a_class <- function(){
  
  # A class seating is defined as 28 of the 30 students in a vector. We only
  # need 28 because the last two, by assumption, sit at the table with Cian/Alex
  # and, therefore, don't matter to our calculations. The function could be a
  # one-line --- list(sample(class30)[1:28]) --- but I like to show the individual
  # steps.
  
  # I think that returning a list is necessary because I am going to assign the
  # result as a list-column.
  
  x <- sample(class30)
  x <- x[1:28]

calc_clumped_tables <- function(seating){
  
  # Given a seating --- which, again, is just a vector of length 28 with Ms and
  # Fs in random order --- how many clumped tables are there? We will define a
  # clumped table as one that is all M or all F. As discussed in class, there
  # are other definitions of "clumping" that we could use.
  
  # Good functions test to see if their assumptions are met. See the chapter in

  # It is not obvious how to do this elegantly. So, I just hack it! (Stole this
  # approach from Beau, I think.) I grab out each table, one at a time, knowing
  # that I have arbitrarily decided that seats 1 through 4 are Table 1, seats 5
  # through 8 are Table 2 and so on. Then, I create a logical vector reporting
  # whether or the person at each seat is Female. Then, I sum up this vector. If
  # it is all Male, the sum will be zero. It it is all Female, the sum will be
  # four. Check that, and sum of the results for each table. Obviously, you need
  # to do a fair bit of fussing to make sure this is working. Test cases would
  # be good!
